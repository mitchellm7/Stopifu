# Stopifu

Stopifu is a web application intended to aid the creation and optimization of stoplists.
A stoplist is a list of stopwords, or words filtered out before the processing of text.  Stoplists are parameters for a range of processes including text mining and topic modeling.
Stopifu builds from the concept (and bits of code) from Michael Kipp's Stopify.  (Stopify Repo: https://github.com/MichaelKipp/Stopify)
